# Gittik

Main idea of the Gittik:
- Search Git repos.
- Load author details.
- Feature some repos.
- Store locally: last serach and fetured repos.


## Getting Started

Here is the code example of using:
- Carthage.
- Networking layer using Moya/RxMoya with custom extensions.
- Map JSON using the ObjectMapping.
- Using some Signals and RxSwift.
- Architecture MVVM (without UI binding).
- All UI implemented in code using PureLayout.

## Installing
All dependencies are included to Git repo. 
(I know that it's not a good idea - but I used it)

If projects doesn't compile - just run
```
carthage update --platform iOS
```
